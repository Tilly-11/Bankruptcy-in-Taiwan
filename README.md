# Bankruptcy-in-Taiwan
**Overview**
In this project, I explore data collected by a team of Taiwanese economists to predict whether a company will go bankrupt. This exercise combines fundamental data science and machine learning techniques, focusing on handling imbalanced data and building strong classification models.
___

**Objectives**
By completing this project, I was able to:

- Navigate a file system from the Linux command line
- Load and save files using Python
- Address imbalanced datasets using resampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE, undersampling)
- Evaluate model performance with classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score

**Key Skills Used**
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Data Preprocessing
- Handling Imbalanced Data
- Classification Modeling
- Model Evaluation Metrics
- Linux Command Line Basics

Project Highlights
This project strengthens key skills required for real-world machine learning tasks, especially in domains where data imbalance is a critical challenge. Predicting bankruptcy accurately is crucial for financial forecasting and risk management, and this project provides a practical approach to solving such classification problems.
